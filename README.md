# HiTIN standalone

It is yet another and a standalone implementation of [HiTIN: Hierarchy-aware Tree Isomorphism Network for Hierarchical Text Classification](https://github.com/Rooooyy/HiTIN). The code here should be simple and easy to follow, and can be adapted as a standalone module with ease.

Disclaimer: I haven't run any dataset experiment of the original paper.
